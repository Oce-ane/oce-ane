<h1 align='center'>Hello 👋</h1>
<h3>I'm Océane, a passionate full-stack developer based in the mesmerising landscapes of the Indian Ocean 🏝️. </h3>

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deep into the realms of Next.js and Python, crafting user experiences one component at a time.

🤝 I'm looking for junior full-stack opportunities where I can bring my enthusiasm for problem-solving and creativity in coding. My strong communication skills and ability to work well in teams allow me to collaborate effectively on projects. With a knack for organisation and a commitment to continuous learning, I aim to contribute to dynamic and innovative development environments.
